### Pixel Density

It's the quantity of pixels that exist within a physical area of the screen (PPI - pixels per inch).
It can vary from device to device.
The higher the pixel density on the screen, the higher the resolution and detail.

React Native renders elements in a way that is independent of the characteristics and densities of each device, maintaining a consistent user interface.

### FlatList x ScrollView

Both add scrolling when items don't fit on the screen.
The ScrollView loads all components at once, even if they are not displayed.
FlatList loads components as they appear and is recommended for displaying large lists.
