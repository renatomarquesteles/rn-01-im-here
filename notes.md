### Pixel Density

It's the quantity of pixels that exist within a physical area of the screen (PPI - pixels per inch).
It can vary from device to device.
The higher the pixel density on the screen, the higher the resolution and detail.

React Native renders elements in a way that is independent of the characteristics and densities of each device, maintaining a consistent user interface.
